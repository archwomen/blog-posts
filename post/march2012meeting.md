Hi! I'll just list our agenda bullets ([as announced][announce]) and
what the discussion results are.

A full copy of the chat log is located [here][log].

Please feel free to add any thoughts and ideas in the comments or via
the contact form linked above!

### Meeting Notes

#### Why has Arch Linux lost female contributors? Can we get statistics and stories?

We spoke to one so far. She switched to another distribution, further
details are unknown.

- We might try to find more former women Arch users by asking around
  other Linux and FOSS women communities.

#### How can we increase the number of women users and contributors?

- Provide 'how to contribute' guidelines on archwomen.org or link to and
  update/maintain/watch official related Arch Linux Wiki page(s). (We
  started maintaining [getting involved][involved])
- Link to list of non-english-language arch communities (done on [Join
  page][join])
- Offer direct email support for helping the right documentation or
  contact person
- List support persons: + on IRC, individuals from the community with
  contact information

#### How can we help Arch Linux retain female contributors?

- Make quick tasks easier to find and learn, for example orphaned
  packages:
    - Link to wiki page explaining how to adopt orphans
    - Discuss and eventually request [{archweb}][archweb] feature:
      rss/atom feed of recently orphaned packages
- Offer more recognition, for example via [package workload
  rankings][rankings]
  (needs more thought)
- Link to Arch wiki page about packaging

#### Mentorship program: create or join?

- One good entry point for potential junior devs would be taking care of
  orphans and helping with rebuilds
- Research: is there still a mentorship program for Arch? Do other Linux
  distributions have similar projects?
    - There was an Arch mentoring project in [April 2010][april]

#### IRC tutorial events: Arch Install parties, How to make Arch Linux Packages, etc

Will be discussed next meeting

### Next meeting: April 1st, 2012

12:00 noon US/Central Time
20:00 GMT+2 Eastern European Time
