----------

There is a [call for talks](https://ohiolinux.org/node/186) for the Ohio LinuxFest (September
28-30 2012) event being advertised as:

>   We put a lot of effort into trying to be familly-friendly and trying
>   to be as inclusive as possible. We would love to have more women or
>   minorities, or just as much of a mix of people as we possibly can.
>   ... We don't just talk the talk, we do our best to walk the walk on
>   this one.

In the [second episode](http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=0943) of the "Freedom isn't Free" podcast.  Their
code of conduct reflects this and I was confirmed by email that they are
[actively looking](https://ohiolinux.org/node/190) for women giving talks on advanced topics this
year.

The overall theme of Ohio LinuxFest is not just Linux but "all parts of
Free and Open Source projects". If have something to contribute,
I encourage you to apply!

There will also be a "Diversity in Open Source" [workshop](https://ohiolinux.org/dios:W) as part of
the event.
