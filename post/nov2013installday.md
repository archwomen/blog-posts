----------

Curious about [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/)? Know someone who is?

Arch Women will be hosting Arch Linux Install Day on Sunday, November 18th, all day on our [IRC channel](http://archwomen.org//index.php/2012/join), #archlinux-women on the Freenode network.

What you'll need,

* [Official installation media](https://www.archlinux.org/download/) (a full-fledged Arch Linux system in under 500 MB; available for optical and flash media)
* the [Beginners' Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners_Guide) (read it, you don't have to understand it)
* three hours of free time (normally installs take less than an hour but you'll need some time to brag and show off your shiny new Arch system :P)
* Virtualbox (optional, if you don't feel like installing to real hardware; a great way to test and play with Arch)
* tacos or poutine (not optional, the pacman god must be appeased)

You can find detailed information about Arch Linux and full documentation on the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Main_Page).

We'll help you get your Arch system up and running in no time. Be sure to drop by. It'll be fun!
