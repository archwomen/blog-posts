I am very excited to announce that Arch Linux Women is now being sponsored by
[Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com). If you haven't heard of them,
Digital Ocean is a VPS host that offers **fast** SSD storage, an easy to use
control panel with 2 factor authentication, backup snapshots and **most
importantly** -- Arch Linux support!

Arch Women can not do what we do without the support of the wider FOSS
community. We needed more resources for our sites and services, and Digital
Ocean stepped up to help. Working with their team has been great and it took us
only moments to get an Arch Linux droplet deployed and booted.

After logging into the Digital Ocean control panel, we choose our location,
droplet size, host name and operating system (Arch Linux 64 bit) and then
clicked "create droplet". 55 seconds later, we had a new Arch Linux virtual private 
server deployed and booted. 

The only issue we ran into was with the ptr record for our domain. A ptr or
reverse DNS record sets the reverse lookup for your IP address. We initally
didn't see how to set the ptr record. After talking to Digital Ocean's support 
team on IRC, they let us know that the ptr record is set using the hostname for 
your droplet. So we named our Digial Ocean droplet "archwomen.org" and
everything is working perfectly. 

All of our web sites, git repositories and software development projects 
are now using Digital Ocean's hosting platform. Now that we don't need to worry about 
system resources, we can focus on our mission - to get more women involved with Arch 
Linux and free open source software.

This new partnership will help jump start our teaching and internship
initiatives and allow us to reach out to more people. If you would like to get
involved with our work, please jump into our IRC channel on Freenode located at
\#archlinux-women, we love new people!
