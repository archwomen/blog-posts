There is still a lot of work to be done in getting the website and project
organized, but we've come a long way in only 3 days with the help of the amazing
arch linux community. I hope the momentum keeps going. I can't express how
excited I am to be involved.

Arch Women will be used as a place for dialogue and information sharing as well
as for networking and supporting the minority users of Arch Linux.

There still needs to be some development done on the website, but Arch Women is
officially ready for content now!

We need a defined mission statement to be drafted, and a rules of conduct page,
but most importantly, we need contributions to the blog.

I can't wait to read submissions from the community. Anything from opinion
pieces and FOSS event experiences to tutorials and artwork will be welcome.
Here's to making Arch Linux rock even more!
