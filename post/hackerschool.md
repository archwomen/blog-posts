Ever wanted to spend 3 months honing your coding skills full time? 

Hacker School is a 100% free programming school in New York that is 
project-based, self-directed, and largely unstructured. Their primary 
source of income is from recruiters who regularly recruit from the pool 
of alumni after each 3-month "batch" (composed of about 60 people each). 

Not only are they free, but they also offer a limited number of 
need-based grants for women to the tune of about $5000 (for living 
expenses). 

Unlike the dismal state of diversity in the free software community, 
Hacker School's student body is usually made of approximately 35-40% 
women, so female applicants need not fear feeling out of place. 

Who is Hacker School for? The answer is anyone who already has a good 
deal of programming experience, but wants to improve their programming 
skills in whatever direction they please. Hacker School is unstructured 
and platform/language-agnostic. It's more like a writing workshop than 
an actual school, but in a creative field such as programming, the 
former structure might actually be more helpful than the latter. 

The early-admission deadline for the Winter Batch (from February 10 to 
May 1) has already passed, but the official deadline is December 14th, 
so there's still time apply. If you can't make that deadline or would 
prefer to apply for the Summer Batch (early June to late August), you 
can find more information at their website.
