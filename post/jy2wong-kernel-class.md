jy2wong will be teaching a class called, *A First Look at the Linux Kernel*. The class will cover the role of kernels in a system, why you might want to consider compiling your own, and tips for not getting lost in the configuration process during your first Linux kernel compile.

Prerequisites: While not necessary, it is useful to be familiar with [ABS][] before taking the class. If you are unfamiliar with PKGBUILDs, logs from [past classes][] make an excellent primer.

The class will be Saturday, May 31, 2014 at 16:00 UTC in the IRC channel #archlinux-classroom on the Freenode network. If there is enough interest, the class may also be held a second time on that day for people from East Asia and Oceania. If you want the class being held again for those timezones, please email us at admin@archwomen.org or stop by our IRC channel and let us know.

About jy2wong in her own words: I'm a university student from Canada, studying/doing research in something involving signal processing (that lies somewhere between math and computers). I've installed Arch Linux on my laptop about 4 times now, and the first 3 times were in my first week of using Arch Linux (that was about 5 years ago). I've been compiling my own kernel for the last 3 or 4 years. I think I'm allergic to cats.

Arch Classroom is a project to create and host interactive tutorials for the wider Arch Linux community. The aim is to increase the knowledge of users of all skill levels on a variety of topics. It is hosted and run by Arch Women.
