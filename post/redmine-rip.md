We've had to stop using Redmine as our project tracker.  Redmine is
awesome.  It is easy to use and has a nice interface.  We were excited when
we put it up.  And we are sad to take it down.  But the maintenance
overhead of Redmine and Ruby turned out to be too much for us.  For now,
we're using [dokuwiki pages](/wiki/aw-org:todo) to track our project to-dos and statuses.
Sometimes less is more.
