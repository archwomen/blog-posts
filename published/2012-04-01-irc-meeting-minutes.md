# IRC Meeting Notes 2012-04-01 Notes

After two hours of [#archlinux-women][irc] discussion, we had an
ambitious list of tasks and a handful of volunteers.

## Tasks

- (DONE added to [IRC page][irc]) Set up official Arch Women office
  hours, so people will have a time frame during which they can get
  guaranteed reactions on IRC, probably Saturday Afternoon (US Central)
- Create beginner learning/teaching material on creating and maintaining
  Arch Linux packages (PKGBUILDs)
    - Learn and apply [Ubuntu Classroom][classroom] and [Linux Chix
      Course][chix] practices
    - Write up how to make a PKGBUILD step-by-step as well as how to
      test, package and upload the relevant files ([Bash Wikibook
      inspiration][bash])
    - Make commented versions of PKGBUILDS
    - Handle special case PKGBUILDs like ruby, java, git packages
    - Create a discussion thread on writing the PKGBUILD tutorial and
      call for contributions
    - Once the material for the PKGBUILD class is created, call for
      teachers and support as well as advertise the project
- Improve existing [package development documentation][packaging],
  making sure to refer to proto PKGBUILDs (`/usr/share/pacman/*`) and
  `man PKGBUILD`
- Share geek/Linux women events via Atom/RSS/iCalendar
    - Relevant events include our meeting dates, office hours, classes
      as well as events and classes by other women geek/Linux groups
    - Possible solutions: Google Calendar, b2evolution
    - As long as no calendar is in place, use Archwomen blog feed
- Request official Arch Pad ([Etherpad][etherpad] software) for use by
  devs and class teachers
- Request arch-women mailing list on [Arch mailman][mailman] or host own
  to ease public discussion outside of meetings
- Write a post on Privacy Protection
- Have Archwomen.org covered by SSL
