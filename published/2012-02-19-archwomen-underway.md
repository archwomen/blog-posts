# Arch Women is Underway!

There is still a lot of work to be done in getting the website and
project organized, but we've come a long way in only 3 days with the
help of the amazing arch linux community.  I hope the momentum keeps
going. I can't express how excited I am to be involved.

Arch Women will be used as a place for dialogue and information sharing
as well as for networking and supporting the minority users of Arch
Linux.

There still needs to be some development done on the website, but Arch
Women is officially ready for content now!

We need a defined mission statement to be drafted, and a rules of
conduct page, but most importantly, we need contributions to the blog.

I can't wait to read submissions from the community.  Anything from
opinion pieces and FOSS event experiences to tutorials and artwork will
be welcome. Here's to making Arch Linux rock even more!
