# Second IRC Meeting Agenda

The first IRC meeting got us off to a great start. Now its time to have
another one! The second Arch Women meeting is being held at 12 PM
US/Central (UTC-5), 20:00 Eastern Europe (UTC+3) on the
[#archlinux-women][irc] IRC channel.

## What We've Accomplished Since the Last Meeting

1. (And most importantly) We have gained more members, lets keep
   spreading the word!
2. More Website Content has been posted:
    - A "[how to contribute][how]" page is under contruction.
    - Links to non-English Arch Linux groups were posted on [about
      page][about].
    - An article on reporting harassment within the arch community is
      nearly done.
    - Links to package maintaining and bug fixing guidelines on the wiki
      have been posted, more information on those to come.
3. We contributed to ArchWiki's [Getting Involved][involved], attempting
   to make it cleaner and leaner [[article changes May 2012][changes]]

## Meeting Agenda

1. Teaching / Mentorship Program. Some ideas:
    - Maybe have official "office hours" for answering questions,
      teaching and helping users with scripts and packages.
    - Hold IRC tutorial sessions or week long crash courses on package
      maintaining or bug fixing, etc. An example along these lines:
      [Ubuntu Classroom][classroom].
2. Website Feature Requests
    - Some information / links on how women can protect their privacy
      and prevent malicious behavior against them online.
    - SSL encryption on the site (underway).
    - Posts on events held by other organizations ([Ladies Learning
      Code][ladies]) has some upcoming events).
3. Open Discussion and Suggestions

As always, please feel free to comment on the agenda, join us on Sunday
for the Meeting, or e-mail us at <admin@archwomen.org>.
