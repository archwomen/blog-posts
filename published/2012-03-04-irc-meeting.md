##Meeting Notes

###Why has Arch Linux lost female contributors? Can we get statistics and stories?

* We spoke to one so far. She switched to another distribution, further details are unknown.
* We might try to find more former women Arch users by asking around other Linux and FOSS women communities.

###How can we increase the number of women users and contributors?

* Provide 'how to contribute' guidelines on archwomen.org or link to and update/maintain/watch official related Arch Linux Wiki page(s). (We started maintaining getting involved)
* Link to list of non-english-language arch communities (done on Join page)
* Offer direct email support for helping to provide the right documentation or contact person
* List support persons: + on IRC, individuals from the community with contact information

###How can we help Arch Linux retain female contributors?

* Make quick tasks easier to find and learn, for example orphaned packages:
    * Link to wiki page explaining how to adopt orphans
    * Discuss and eventually request {archweb} feature: rss/atom feed of recently orphaned packages
    * Offer more recognition, for example via package workload rankings (needs more thought)
    * Link to Arch wiki page about packaging
* Mentorship program: create or join?
    * One good entry point for potential junior devs would be taking care of orphans and helping with rebuilds
    * Research: is there still a mentorship program for Arch? Do other Linux distributions have similar projects?
        *There was an Arch mentoring project in April 2010
* IRC tutorial events: Arch Install parties, How to make Arch Linux Packages, etc - Will be discussed next meeting

Next meeting: April 1st, 2012
12:00 noon US/Central Time
20:00 GMT+2 Eastern European Time
