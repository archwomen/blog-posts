# Scholarship Program for Female Students of Hacker School by Etsy

From the [Etsy Blog](http://www.etsy.com/hacker-grants):

    Today, in conjunction with Hacker School, Etsy is announcing a new
    scholarship and sponsorship program for women in technology: we’ll
    be hosting the summer 2012 session of Hacker School in the Etsy
    headquarters, and we’re providing ten Etsy Hacker Grants of $5,000
    each — a total of $50,000 — to women who want to join but need
    financial support to do so. Our goal is to bring 20 women to New
    York to participate, and we hope this will be the first of many
    steps to encourage more women into engineering at Etsy and across
    the industry.
