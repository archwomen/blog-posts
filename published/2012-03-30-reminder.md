# Reminder: Second IRC meeting is on Sunday

Hey folks, this is a reminder that the second Arch Linux Women meeting
will be on Sunday in our IRC channel. The time of the meeting is 12 PM
US/Central (UTC-5), 20:00 Eastern Europe (UTC+3). This was changed from
previous announcements to reflect a shift to summer time.

An agenda should be posted either later today or tomorrow. If you have
any suggestions for the agenda you can still make them. Either by
posting a comment or emailing us ([admin@archwomen.org][mail]).

See you then!
