# AdaCamp July 10 - 11 in DC, Applications are Open

**Link:** http://dc.adacamp.org/apply/

AdaCamp DC will be July 10 - 11, 2012, in Washington DC, co-located with
Wikimania 2012. We are likely to have more applications than available
slots, so apply now to have the best chance of attending. Applications
close June 15 (May 11 for those requesting travel assistance).

## Who Should Apply:

AdaCamp DC will bring together a wide variety of people from open
technology and culture, all of whom are working to support women in open
tech/culture. We're looking for people who:

- Participate in open technology and culture: any field involving
  open/grassroots/community participation and sharing the results of
  your work for free: open data, open source software, wikis, open
  government, open libraries, remix/fan culture, open video, and more
- Can share information about women's experiences in that field,
  including talking about women's achievements and the challenges they
  face
- Want to work together and share strategies to support and promote
  women in the field
- Share the Ada Initiative's feminist approach to supporting and
  promoting women in open technology and culture
- Are young and old; students, professionals and hobbyists; from
  a diverse range of backgrounds; and reflect the breadth of the open
  technology and culture field

AdaCamp is open to people of all genders. However, since AdaCamp and the
Ada Initiative exist to support and promote women in open technology and
culture, prospective attendees who are not themselves women will need to
demonstrate a high level of prior engagement and experience with the
issues faced by women in those fields in order to be invited.
