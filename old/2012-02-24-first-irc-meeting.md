# First Arch Women IRC Meeting

The very first Arch Women meeting will be held on March 4th @ 12:00 noon
US/Central Time, 20:00 GMT+2 Eastern Europe Time.

## Agenda:

- Why has Arch Linux lost female contributors? Can we get some stats on
  how many there were and how long they stayed? Perhaps contact people
  who left and ask them why they left?
- How can we increase the number of women users and contributors?
- How can we help Arch Linux retain female contributors?
- Mentorship program?
- IRC tutorial events: Arch Install parties, How to make Arch Linux
  Packages, etc.

I've read through a few studies on female attrition rate within FOSS
projects. It seems that by the 5 year mark, 60% of women stop
contributing to the projects they were involved in. Reasons given were:
women felt unrecognized for their contributions, women felt isolated
within the group, and women who started to have kids/career
responsibilities had less time to contribute and the way many projects
are set up means you need larger chunks of time to contribute instead of
smaller time chunks.

I would like to try and figure out if this applies to Arch Linux, and if
this is so, what sort of changes could be made to make Arch Linux more
accessible / appealing to women contributors.

If anyone out there would like to add in something to the agenda, leave
a comment on this post, or come join us on March 4th.
