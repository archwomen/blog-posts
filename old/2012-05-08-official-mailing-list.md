# Official Mailing List

**Link:** http://archwomen.org/mailman/listinfo/members_archwomen.org/

After a bit of work, I've got a mailing list set up using GNU Mailman.
Subscribers should now be able to send a message to
<members@archwomen.org> and have all the subscribers receive the message
sent. There is also a message archive on the list. Please contact us if
you run into any problems or need help signing up.
